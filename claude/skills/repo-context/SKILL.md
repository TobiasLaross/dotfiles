# Repo Context Workflow

The user has invoked `/repo-context`. Your job is to scan all Git repositories across the two developer directories and produce or refresh a context file for each one.

Context files live at: `~/.claude/repo-context/<repo-name>.md`

---

## Step 1 — Discover repos

Run these two commands to collect all repos:

```bash
ls ~/Developer/work/ 2>/dev/null
ls ~/Developer/personal/ 2>/dev/null
```

Build a flat list of entries in the form `<source>/<repo-name>` where source is `work` or `personal`, e.g.:

```
work/api-service
work/mobile-app
personal/side-project
```

If the user supplied an argument, filter the list to only repos whose name matches.

Ensure `~/.claude/repo-context/` exists:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/repo-context
```

---

## Step 2 — Process repos in parallel batches

Split the repo list into chunks of up to **10 repos**. For each chunk, launch all subagents **in parallel** (in a single message with multiple Agent tool calls, all with `run_in_background: true`).

Wait for each batch to complete before starting the next batch.

For each repo, spawn a `general-purpose` subagent with the prompt template below. Substitute the actual values for `REPO_NAME`, `REPO_PATH`, and `CONTEXT_FILE`.

---

## Subagent prompt template

```
You are building a context file for a single Git repository so that Claude can quickly understand it in future sessions.

## Your assignment

Repo name:    <REPO_NAME>
Repo path:    <REPO_PATH>
Context file: <CONTEXT_FILE>

## Phase 1 — Load existing context (if any)

Check whether the context file already exists:

  cat "<CONTEXT_FILE>" 2>/dev/null

If it exists, read it carefully. You will update it — keeping what is still accurate, correcting what is wrong or outdated, and filling in anything missing.

## Phase 2 — Understand the repo

Work through the following, spending more time where there is more signal:

1. **Identity** — Read README.md (or README, README.rst, docs/README.md). If absent, check the repo root for any `.md` files.
2. **Language & build system** — Detect from: package.json, go.mod, go.sum, Podfile, Podfile.lock, build.gradle, pom.xml, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, setup.py, requirements.txt, Makefile, .xcode*, *.xcworkspace, *.xcodeproj.
3. **Entry points** — Find main files, server start-up, CLI entry points, app delegates, etc.
4. **Architecture** — Read 10–20 key source files to understand the major layers, modules, or services inside the repo. Focus on structure, not line-by-line detail.
5. **Dependencies on other internal repos** — Search for references to sibling repo names found in ~/Developer/work/ and ~/Developer/personal/ inside: package.json (dependencies/devDependencies), go.mod (replace directives or module imports), Podfile (local path pods), import statements, or any workspace/monorepo config.
6. **External service communication** — Grep for patterns that reveal how this service talks to the outside world:
   - REST: `http.Get`, `fetch(`, `axios`, `URLSession`, `Alamofire`, `httpClient`, `baseURL`, `.get(`, `.post(`
   - gRPC: `.proto` files, `grpc`, `protobuf`, `connectrpc`
   - GraphQL: `gql`, `graphql`, `Apollo`
   - WebSocket: `websocket`, `ws://`, `wss://`
   - Message queues: `kafka`, `rabbitmq`, `nats`, `pubsub`, `SQS`, `SNS`
   - Databases: connection strings, ORM configs, migration files
   For each hit, record what it communicates with (endpoint, topic, service name) if discernible.
7. **Environment / config** — Scan `.env.example`, `config/`, `*.yml`, `*.yaml`, `*.toml` for service names, base URLs, and feature flags that reveal integrations.
8. **CI/CD & deployment** — Glance at `.github/workflows/`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `k8s/`, `*.tf` to understand how the service is built and deployed.

## Phase 3 — Write the context file

Write (or overwrite) `<CONTEXT_FILE>` with the following structure. Be concise but complete — this file is read by Claude, not humans, so prefer dense, accurate prose over padding.

---

```md
# <REPO_NAME>

## Purpose
One or two sentences describing what this repo does and who/what uses it.

## Responsibility
What problem does this repo own? What are its boundaries (what does it NOT do)?

## Language & stack
Primary language, framework(s), build tool.

## Architecture
Brief description of the internal structure: layers, major packages/modules, key patterns (MVC, clean arch, event-driven, etc.).

## Entry points
How is the repo started, invoked, or consumed? (CLI command, server binary, library import, mobile app target, etc.)

## Internal repo dependencies
List sibling repos from ~/Developer/work/ or ~/Developer/personal/ that this repo depends on, with a one-line reason each.
- none (if none found)

## Repos that likely depend on this one
List sibling repos that appear to import or call this repo (if you can infer it from naming or config).
- none (if none found)

## External communication
Describe how this service communicates with the outside world. For each protocol/integration:
- **REST** → [endpoint base URLs or service names]
- **gRPC** → [proto service names or endpoints]
- **GraphQL** → [schema or client details]
- **WebSocket** → [what streams]
- **Message queue** → [topic/queue names, broker]
- **Database** → [type, ORM, migration tool]
Omit sections that do not apply.

## Environment & config
Key environment variables or config values that affect behaviour (from .env.example, config files, etc.).

## Deployment
How is this built and deployed? (Docker, k8s, GitHub Actions, Xcode, etc.)

## Notes for Claude
Any quirks, conventions, or gotchas that are useful to know when working in this repo.

## Last updated
<today's date in YYYY-MM-DD>
```

---

## Rules

- Do not truncate any section — if you cannot determine the answer write "Unknown".
- If updating an existing file: preserve sections that are still accurate, correct outdated info, and add missing sections.
- Do not include raw file dumps or long code snippets in the context file — summarise instead.
- Today's date for "Last updated" is <TODAY>.
```

---

## Step 3 — Report

After all batches complete, report to the user:
- How many repos were processed
- How many context files were created vs updated
- The path `~/.claude/repo-context/`
- Any repos that failed or could not be read (e.g. empty repos, permission errors)
